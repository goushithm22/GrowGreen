## 🧠 What I Focused On

### 🧹 Clean Code
- Semantic tags (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.) for better structure and accessibility.
- Consistent indentation and meaningful class names.
- Avoided unnecessary styling duplication — used CSS efficiently.

### 🎨 Design Learning
- Learned **basic layout structure** (header > sections > footer).
- Practiced consistent spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.
- Chose a minimal, natural color scheme appropriate for the theme.
- Prioritized **readability and usability** over visual noise.

### 📱 Responsive Thinking
- Designed with mobile responsiveness in mind.
- Used CSS media queries and flexible containers to ensure layout adaptability.
